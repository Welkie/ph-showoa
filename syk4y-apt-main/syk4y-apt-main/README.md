# syk4y

`syk4y` is a CLI to make Kaggle artifact workflows simple and repeatable:
- initialize per-artifact Kaggle dataset folders
- upload only changed artifacts
- build and reuse offline `wheelhouse.zip`
- optionally generate `kaggle_upload/gen-full.py`

## Start Here (Fast Path)

```bash
# 1) Install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y syk4y

# 2) Go to your repo
cd /path/to/your/repo

# 3) Check environment
syk4y doctor

# 4) Initialize artifact datasets (first time per repo)
syk4y init checkpoints datasets models wheelhouse

# 5) Configure Kaggle credentials (interactive)
syk4y kaggle login

# 6) Upload changed artifacts
syk4y kaggle upload
```

If this is all you need, you can stop here.

## Install

### apt (signed repository)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://taiduc1001.github.io/syk4y-apt/keys/syk4y-archive-keyring.gpg \
  | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/syk4y-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/syk4y-archive-keyring.gpg] https://taiduc1001.github.io/syk4y-apt stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syk4y.list

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y syk4y
```

## Before You Run

### Python runtime

`syk4y` needs a usable Python interpreter.
Selection order:
1. `PYTHON_BIN` (if set)
2. local venv in repo (`.venv`, `venv`, `.env`, `env`, similar names)
3. `uv python find`
4. system `python3` / `python`

Recommended local setup:

```bash
uv venv .venv
uv pip install kaggle
```

### Kaggle credentials

You need Kaggle credentials for `syk4y kaggle upload`.

Get token:
1. Log in to `https://www.kaggle.com`
2. Open Account settings
3. In API section, click `Create New Token`

Use credentials in one of these ways:

Interactive:

```bash
syk4y kaggle login
```

Explicit flags:

```bash
syk4y kaggle login --username <kaggle_username> --key <kaggle_api_key>
```

Environment variables:

```bash
export KAGGLE_USERNAME=<kaggle_username>
export KAGGLE_KEY=<kaggle_api_key>
syk4y kaggle upload
```

## Common Tasks

### 1) First-time setup for a repo

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
syk4y init checkpoints datasets models wheelhouse
```

This creates `kaggle_upload/` layout and metadata for each artifact dataset.
If `wheelhouse` is included, `wheelhouse.zip` is built/updated.

### 2) Upload only what changed

```bash
syk4y kaggle upload
```

Upload selected artifacts only:

```bash
syk4y kaggle upload datasets
syk4y kaggle upload wheelhouse
```

Useful options:

```bash
syk4y kaggle upload --force
syk4y kaggle upload --message "weekly refresh"
syk4y kaggle upload --dir-mode zip
```

### 3) Build wheelhouse only (no Kaggle auth required)

```bash
syk4y kaggle upload --build-wheel-only
```

Wheelhouse dependency source:

- If `uv.lock` exists, syk4y exports the locked dependencies with `uv export --locked`.
  The lockfile must be up to date, and local/Git/URL sources are preserved.
- If `uv.lock` does not exist, syk4y falls back to the installed environment from
  `pip freeze`.

### 4) Install dependencies offline from wheelhouse

```bash
unzip wheelhouse.zip -d wheelhouse

# uv (recommended)
uv pip install --offline --no-index --find-links /path/to/wheelhouse <package-or-requirements>

# pip
pip install --no-index --find-links /path/to/wheelhouse <package-or-requirements>
```

### 5) Generate full repo snapshot script

```bash
syk4y gen
```

Notes:
- `gen` requires a git work tree unless you pass `--skip-gen`
- default output is `kaggle_upload/gen-full.py`

To generate snapshot and initialize artifact folders together:

```bash
syk4y gen -a checkpoints -a datasets -a models -a wheelhouse
```

## Command Cheat Sheet

### Top-level

```bash
syk4y [--repo-root DIR] <command>
```

Commands:
- `init` setup Kaggle artifact folders and metadata
- `gen` generate snapshot script (`gen-full.py`)
- `kaggle` Kaggle helpers and multi-account tools
- `doctor` environment/readiness checks

### `syk4y init`

```bash
syk4y init [--repo-root DIR] [options] <artifact...>
```

Options:
- `-u, --upload-dir DIR`
- `-w, --wheelhouse FILE`

### `syk4y gen`

```bash
syk4y gen [options]
```

Key options:
- `--repo-root DIR`
- `--skip-gen`
- `-a, --artifact NAME` (repeatable)
- `-o, --out FILE`
- `-w, --wheelhouse FILE`
- `-u, --upload-dir DIR`

### `syk4y kaggle`

```bash
syk4y kaggle <subcommand> [options]
```

Subcommands:
- `login` configure `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
- `upload` upload changed artifacts to Kaggle
- `account` manage account pool (`add/list/remove/enable/disable/test/set`)
- `run` multi-account notebook runner (`start/status/list/pull/stop/resume`)

### `syk4y doctor`

```bash
syk4y doctor [--repo-root DIR] [--json]
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1) "Kaggle credentials are not configured"

```bash
syk4y kaggle login
```

Or set env vars:

```bash
export KAGGLE_USERNAME=...
export KAGGLE_KEY=...
```

### 2) Python not found / pip unavailable

```bash
uv venv .venv
uv pip install kaggle
```

Then rerun command in the same repo.

### 3) Upload says nothing changed

This is expected change detection behavior.

To force upload:

```bash
syk4y kaggle upload --force
```

### 4) General health check

```bash
syk4y doctor
syk4y doctor --json
```

## Security Notes

- Never commit `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
- Prefer environment variables in CI
- Rotate Kaggle API key if exposed

## Maintainer Notes (Packaging)

For package/repo maintainers:

```bash
scripts/build-deb.sh --version 0.1.0
scripts/build-apt-repo.sh --output-dir site --deb dist/deb/syk4y_0.1.0_all.deb
scripts/sign-apt-release.sh --repo-dir site --suite stable --key-id <KEY_ID>
```

## macOS Support

A macOS installer is created automatically whenever a commit is pushed to `main`.
Each successful run publishes a GitHub prerelease containing:

- `syk4y-<version>-macos-universal.pkg`
- `SHA256SUMS`

Get the latest package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TaiDuc1001/syk4y-apt/releases).

### Install with Homebrew

Install the public `syk4y` formula from the canonical Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew install mihtriii/syk4y/syk4y
syk4y doctor
```

Homebrew 6+ automatically records trust for this fully qualified formula only; it does not trust
every item in the tap. To update later:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade syk4y
```

The macOS release workflow updates [`mihtriii/homebrew-syk4y`](https://github.com/mihtriii/homebrew-syk4y)
after every successful build from `main`.

### Install with the `.pkg` installer

#### 1. Install prerequisites

`syk4y` requires Bash 4 or newer. macOS includes Bash 3.2, so install the current Bash with
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install bash
```

> Apple Silicon installs Homebrew Bash at `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash`; Intel Macs normally use
> `/usr/local/bin/bash`. The installed `syk4y` launcher detects both locations automatically.

#### 2. Download and verify the installer

Download **both** the `.pkg` and `SHA256SUMS` from the same macOS GitHub prerelease, then verify
the exact package before installation:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
```

Continue only if the result is:

```text
syk4y-<version>-macos-universal.pkg: OK
```

#### 3. Install and validate

```bash
sudo installer -pkg syk4y-<version>-macos-universal.pkg -target /
syk4y doctor
```

The installer stores the application payload in `/usr/local/lib/syk4y` and installs these launcher
commands in `/usr/local/bin`:

```text
syk4y
syk4y-init
syk4y-gen
syk4y-kaggle
syk4y-doctor
make-gen-full-repo.sh
```

After installation, use the same commands documented above. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
syk4y doctor
syk4y init checkpoints datasets models wheelhouse
syk4y kaggle login
syk4y kaggle upload
```

### macOS troubleshooting

**`syk4y on macOS requires Bash 4 or newer`**

```bash
brew install bash
```

Then open a new terminal and run `syk4y doctor` again.

**`syk4y: command not found` after installation**

The installer uses `/usr/local/bin`. Check that it is on your shell path:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$PATH"
ls -l /usr/local/bin/syk4y
```

Open a new terminal if the command was installed during the current session.

> The package is currently not code-signed or notarized. It is distributed through GitHub Releases
> with a SHA-256 checksum; verify `SHA256SUMS` before installing.
